What is Room?
=============
Abstraction layer over SQLite to allow for more robust database access

SQLite vs Room
==============
No compile time check of SQL queries | Compile time checks of SQL queries
Updating database, changing schema was difficult | it is easy in Room with Migration classes
converting SQL queries to java objects is difficult and requires too much boilerplate code | Maps datbase objects to java objects very easy with little boilerplate code
Cannot work with LiveData and ViewModel | Room is built to work with LiveData and ViewModel

room check query errors in compile time

Components of Room
==================
Database: An abstract class annotated with @Database and extending RoomDatabase class
Entity: Represents the table in our database
Dao: For every entity a DAO interface is needed that contains function for acessing the database
